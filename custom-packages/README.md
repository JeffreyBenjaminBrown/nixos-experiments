Here is where I develop new packages.
Once a package works, if it's not worth sharing,
I'll just move it into _done/.
If it's worth sharing, I'll integrate it into
[my fork of nixpkgs](https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/nixpkgs),
but still keep a copy of it in _done/,
because I might want to look at it later, and looking through _done/
is easier than looking through my commits to nixpkgs.
